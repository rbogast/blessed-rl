## Current State Assessment:

- __Combat system__: Clean, focused, and maintainable
- __Knockback functionality__: Working perfectly with proper validation and visual feedback
- __Code organization__: Well-structured with clear separation of concerns

## Suggested Next Steps (in order of impact):

### 1. __Performance Optimization__ 🚀

- Add caching for equipment bonus calculations (currently recalculated every attack)
- Optimize entity lookups in combat-heavy scenarios
- Profile the effects system for any bottlenecks

### 2. __Enhanced Combat Features__ ⚔️

- Add more weapon effect types (poison, fire, ice, etc.)
- Implement area-of-effect attacks using the existing shockwave system
- Add weapon reach/range mechanics for different weapon types

### 3. __Visual Polish__ ✨

- Add particle effects for knockback (screen shake, impact indicators)
- Implement damage number pop-ups
- Add visual indicators for weapon effects (bleeding, status effects)

### 4. __Balance & Gameplay__ 🎮

- Fine-tune knockback distances and damage based on playtesting
- Add resistance/immunity systems for different enemy types
- Implement weapon durability and repair mechanics

### 5. __Testing & Robustness__ 🧪

- Add unit tests for the combat helper classes
- Create integration tests for complex combat scenarios
- Add error handling for edge cases in knockback system

__My Recommendation__: Start with __Performance Optimization__ (#1) since the combat system will be used frequently, and any performance gains will have immediate impact on gameplay experience.
